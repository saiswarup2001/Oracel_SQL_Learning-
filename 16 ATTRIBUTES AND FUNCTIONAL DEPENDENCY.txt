------------

1. KEY ATTRIBUTE/CANDIDATE KEY
2. NON-KEY ATTRIBUTE
3. PRIME-KEY ATTRIBUTE
4. NON-PRIME KEY ATTRIBUTE
5. COMPOSITE KEY ATTRIBUTE
6. SUPER KEY ATTRIBUTE
7. FOREIGN KEY ATTRIBUTE














ATTRIBUTES
-----------

1. KEY ATTRIBUTE
   AN ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS USED TO IDENTIFY A RECORD UNIQUELY FROM THE TABLE
IS CALLED KEY ATTRIBUTE.

2. NON-KEY ATTRIBUTE
 ALL THE ATTRIBUTES EXCEPT KEY ATTRIBUTES ARE REFFERED AS NON-KEY ATTRIBUTES.

3. PRIME-KEY ATTRIBUTES 
   AMONG THE KEY ATTRIBUTES AN ATTRIBUTE IS CHOOSEN TO BE THE MAIN ATTRIBUTE 
TO IDENTIFY THE RECORD UNIQUELY FROM THE TABLE.

4. NON- PRIME KEY ATTRIBUTE
  ALL THE KEY ATTRIBUTES EXCEPT PRIME KEY ATTRIBUTE IS REFFERED NON- PRIME KEY ATTRIBUTE.

5. COMPOSITE KEY ATTRIBUTE
 IT IS A COMBINATION OF TWO or MORE NON KEY ATTRIBUTES WHICH IS USED TO IDENTIFY THE 
RECORD UNIQUELY FROM THE TABLE.

6. SUPER KEY ATTRIBUTE 
 IT IS  THE SET OF ALL THE KEY ATTRIBUTES.

7. FOREIGN KEY ATTRIBUTE
 IT BEHAVES AS AN ATTRIBUTE OF ANOTHER ENTITY TO REPRESENT THE RELATION.



























FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY
-------------------------
LET US CONSIDER THE RELATION 'R' WITH TWO ATTRIBUTES 'X' AND 'Y'
RESPECTIVELY. IN WHICH ATTRIBUTE 'X' DETEMINES ATTRIBUTE 'Y'.

or IN OTHER WORDS, 'Y' IS DEPENDENT ON 'X' .
THERE EXISTS FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY.

R --> { X,Y }

  X-->Y
  Y IS DEPENDENT ON X.


















TYPES OF FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY 
------------------------------
1. TOTAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY 
2. PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY
3. TRANSITIVE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY
























1. TOTAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY 

IF ALL THE ATTRIBUTES IN A RELATION ARE DETEMINED BY A SINGLE ATTRIBUTE
WHICH IS A KEY ATTRIBUTE, THEN THERE EXISTS TOTAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY.

- IN TOTAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY THERE ARE NO ANOMALY AND REDUNDANCY.


ANOMALY - THESE ARE THE SIDE EFFECTS WHICH ARE CAUSED DURING THE DML OPERATIONS.

REDUNDANCY - THESE ARE THE REPEATED or DUPLICATE.















EG:- LET US CONSIDER  A RELATION WITH 4 ATTRIBUTES A,B,C & D 
 IN WHICH 'A' IS A KEY ATTRIBUTE

R---> { A,B,C,D }
  
A IS K.A

A--> B
A--> C
A--> D

THEIR EXISTS T.F.D.

A--> { B,C,D }.















2. PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY

 FOR A PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY TO EXIST THERE MUST BE A 
COMPOSITE KEY ATTRIBUTE.

ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTE IN COMPOSITE KEY RELATION DETERMINES ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE SEPERATELY,
AND THIS IS KNOWN AS PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY.

IN PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY WE HAVE REDUNDANCY AND ANOMALY.



















EG:- LET US CONSIDER A RELATION 'R' WITH 4 ATTRIBUTES A,B,C,D IN 
 WHICH A & B ARE COMPOSITE KEY ATTRIBUTES.

R--> { A,B,C,D }

A & B -> C.K.A

(A,B)-->(C,D)
B--> {C}



THEIR EXIST P.F.D.






3. TRANSITIVE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY

IF AN ATTRIBUTE IS DETERMINED BY A NON-KEY ATTRIBUTE WHICH INTERN IS DETERMINED
BY A KEY ATTRIBUTE,THEN THERE EXIST TRANSITIVE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY.

IN TRANSITIVE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY WE HAVE REDUNDANCY AND ANOMALY.





EG:- LET US CONSIDER A RELATION WHITH FOUR ATTRIBUTES  A,B,C, & D
IN WHICH A IS A KEY ATTRIBUTES .

R--> { A,B,C,D }

A IS K.A.
 
A--> B
A--> D
D--> C
A--> C
THIER EXIST T.F.D













NORMALIZATION
--------------

IT IS A PROCESS OF REDUCING THE LARGER TABLE INTO SMALLER TABLE IN ORDER TO
REMOVE REDUNDENCY AND ANOMALY BY IDENTIFYING THEIR FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY.

or

IT IS A PROCESS OF DECOMPOSING A LARGE TABLE INTO SMALLER TABLE TO REMOVE
REDUNDENCY AND ANOMALY.

or

IT IS A PROCESS OF REDUCING THE TABLE TO ITS NORMAL FORM.

NORMAL FORM :- A TABLE WITHOUT REDUNDENCY AND ANOMALY IS SET TO BE IN NORMAL FORM.









LEVELS OF NORMAL FORM
---------------------
1. FIRST NORMAL FORM (1NF)
2. SECOND NORMAL FORM (2NF)
3. THIRD NORMAL FORM (3NF)
4. BOYCE-CODD NORMAL FORM (BCNF)


*********
NOTE:-
A TABLE IS SAID TO BE NORMALIZED IF WE REDUCE THE TABLE TO 
3rd NORMAL FORM.








1. 1NF
 A TABLE IS SAID TO BE IN 1st NORMAL FORM 
 IF IT SATISFIES THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS.
>  A TABLE SHOULD NOT CONSISTS OF MULTI-VALUED DATA.
>  A TABLE SHOULD NOT HAVE DUPLICATE or REPEATED VALUES.






2. 2NF 
 A TABLE IS SAID TO BE IN 2nd NORMAL FORM 
 IF IT SATISFIES THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS.
> THE TABLE SHOULD BE IN 1st NORMAL FORM.
> THE TABLE SHOULD NOT HAVE PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY. 
NOTE: IF THE TABLE CONSISTS OF PARTIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY 
      THEN THE ATTRIBUTES RESPONSIBLE ARE REMOVED FROM THE TABLE.



3. 3NF 
  A TABLE IS SAID TO BE IN 3rd NORMAL FORM 
 IF IT SATISFIES THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS.
> A TABLE SHOULD BE IN 2nd NORMAL FORM.
> A TABLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TRANSITIVE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY.
NOTE: IF THE TABLE CONSISTS OF TRANSITIVE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY 
      THEN THE ATTRIBUTES RESPONSIBLE ARE REMOVED FROM THE TABLE.





4. BOYCE-CODD NORMAL FORM (BCNF)
IT IS THE UPDATED VERSION OF 3NF 
ALSO CALLED 3.5NF .
