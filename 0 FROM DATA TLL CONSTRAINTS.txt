=================================




DATA
----

DATA IS A RAW FACT WHICH DESCRIBES ATTRIBUTES OF AN ENTITY.

















DATABASE
===========

IT IS PLACE WHERE DATA WLL BE STORED IN SYSTEMATIC AND ORGANIZED MANNER.






BASIC OPERATIONS PERFORMED ON DATABASE ARE:-

1. Create/Insert
2. Read/Retrieve
3. Update/Modify
4. Delete/Drop





***
GENERALLY KNOWN AS "CRUD" OPERATIONS.











DBMS (DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM)

DBMS IS A SOFTWARE TO MAINTAIN AND MANAGE DATABASE.

TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE:
1.SECURITY
2.AUTHORIZATION

WE USE QUERY LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE.






























RDBMS

IT IS A TYPE OF DBMS SOFTWARE WERE DATA WLL BE STORED IN FORM OF 
 TABLES.

TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS ARE:
1.SECURITY
2.AUTHORIZATION


WE USE STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE(SQL)  TO COMMUNICATE.

RELATIONAL MODEL
-----------------

IT IS A CONCEPT DESIGNED BY DATA SCIENTIST "E.F.CODD"

IN RELATIONAL MODEL WE STORE THE DATA IN THE FORM OF TABLES.
                             --------------------------------





***
A DBMS SOFTWARE WHICH FOLLOWS RELATIONAL MODEL BECOMES 
RELATIONAL DBMS (RDBMS).









TABLE
-----
TABLE IS A LOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF DATA WHICH CONSISTS OF 
ROWS AND COLUMNS



COLUMNS
--------
COLUMNS IS ALSO REFERRED AS ATTRIBUTES OR FIELDS.

A COLUMN IS USED TO REPRESENT ONE PROPERTY OF ALL THE ENTITIES.


ROWS
-------
ROWS IS ALSO REFERRED AS RECORDS OR TUPPLES .

A ROW IS USED TO REPRESENT ALL THE PROPERTIES OF SINGLE ENTITY.











CELL
----
CELL IS THE SMALLEST UNIT IN TABLE IN WHICH WE STORE DATA.
THE INTER-SECTION OF ROWS AND COLUMNS GENERATE CELLS.









ENTITY
-----
ANYTHING WHICH HAS ITS EXISTANCE.
















RULES OF E.F.CODD
------------------
1. THE DATA STORED IN THE CELL MUST BE A SINGLE VALUE DATA.

2. IN RDBMS WE STORE EVERYTHING IN THE FORM OF TABLES
  INCLUDING META DATA .
  (THE DETAILS ABOUT THE DATA IS META DATA)


****
3.ACCORDING TO E.F.CODD WE CAN STORE DATA IN MULTIPLE TABLES ,
IF NEEDED WE CAN ESTABLISH CONNECTION B/W TWO TABLES USING 
KEY ATTRIBUTES.

***
4. WE CAN VALIDATE THE DATA ENTERED INTO THE TABLE IN TWO STEPS
a. BY ASSIGNING DATATYPES
b. BY ASSIGNING CONSTRAINTS








NOTE:
-----
****
HERE DATATYPES ARE MANDATORY WHEREAS CONSTRAINTS ARE OPTIONAL.

































DATATYPES 
---------
DATATYPES ARE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OR KIND OF DATA WILL BE 
STORED IN A PARTICULAR MEMORY LOCATION.





DATATYPES IN SQL
-----------------

1. CHAR
2. VARCHAR / VARCHAR2
3. NUMBER
4. DATE
5. LARGE OBJECT 
  a. CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT(CLOB)
  b. BINARY LARGE OBJECT(BLOB)

 :- SQL IS NOT CASE SENSITIVE










1. CHAR

CHAR DATATYPE CAN ACCEPT CHARACTERS SUCH AS 
'A-Z',
'a-z',
'0-9' OR 
SPECIAL CHARACTERS (#,*,$,----).








ASCII (AMERICAN STANDARD CODE FOR INFORMATION INTERCHANGE)
A-65
Z-90
a-97
z-122







SYNTAX
-------
 CHAR(SIZE)




SIZE - IT IS USED TO DETERMINE THE NO. OF CHARACTERS  THAT WE CAN STORE.
----





WHENEVER WE MENTION CHAR DATATYPE WE HAVE TO MENTION SIZE FOR IT.

THE MAX. SIZE THAT WE CAN STORE IS 2000.
***
IT IS A TYPE OF "FIXED LENGTH MEMORY ALLOCATION".











2. VARCHAR
VARCHAR DATATYPE CAN ACCEPT CHARACTERS SUCH AS 
'A-Z',
'a-z',
'0-9' OR 
SPECIAL CHARACTERS (#,*,$,----)

SYNTAX
-----
VARCHAR(SIZE)

SIZE - IT IS USED TO DETERMINE THE NO. OF CHARACTERS  THAT WE CAN STORE.
----


WHENEVER WE MENTION VARCHAR DATATYPE WE HAVE TO MENTION SIZE FOR IT.

THE MAX. SIZE THAT WE CAN STORE IS 2000.
***
IT IS TYPE OF "VARIABLE LENGTH MEMORY ALLOCATION"
THERE IS NO WASTAGE OF MEMORY IN VARCHAR.










VARCHAR2
---------
VARCHAR2 IS THE UPDATED VERSION OF VARCHAR.

i.e, THE SIZE IS UPDATED FROM 2000 TO 4000

SYNTAX
--------\
VARCHAR2(SIZE)

THE MAX SIZE WE CAN STORE IS 4000.










1. DIFF. CHAR AND VARCHAR.
2. DIFF. VARCHAR AND VARCHAR2.














3. NUMBER
 THIS DATATYPE IS USED TO STORE NUMERICAL VALUES.

 IT CAN ACCEPT TWO ARGUMENTS:-
a. PRECISION
b. SCALE

SYNTAX
------
NUMBER(PRECISION , [SCALE])




PRECISION
---------
IT IS USED TO DETERMINE THE DIGITS WE ARE GOING TO STORE
IN NUMERICAL PLACE.

SCALE
-------
IT IS USED TO DETERMINE THE NO. OF DIGITS WE ARE GOING TO STORE
IN DECIMAL PLACE WITHIN THE PRECISION.


THE MAX PRECISION WE CAN STORE IS 38.
THE MAX SCALE WE CAN STORE IS 127.







NUMBER(2,8) 
NUMBER(7,3)
NUMBER(8,2)
NUMBER(5,5)
NUMBER(4,8)
NUMBER(5,8)
NUMBER(8,3)















4.DATE
------

SYNTAX - DATE
-------

THE TWO ORACLE SPECIFIED DATE FORMATS ARE

a. 'DD-MON-YY'

b. 'DD-MON-YYYY'


 .
. .  DATE SHOULD ALWAYS BE ENCLOSED WITHIN SINGLE QUOTES..








5. LARGE OBJECT 
a. CLOB (CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT)

 THIS IS USED TO STORE THE CHARACTERS UPTO 4GB OF SIZE.


SYNTAX  - CLOB
-------

b. BLOB (BINARY LARGE OBJECT)

 THIS IS USED TO STORE BINARY NUMBERS OF IMAGES,VIDEOS,FILE ETC.. 
UPTO 4GB OF SIZE.

SYNTAX  - BLOB
-------


















1. DIFFERNECE B/W CHAR AND VARCHAR
2. DIFF. B/W VARCHAR AND VARCHAR2







CONSTRAINTS:-
-----------

CONSTRAINTS ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR COLUMN
TO VALIDATE THE DATA.


TYPES OF CONSTRAINTS:-
----------------------
1. UNIQUE
2. NOT NULL
3. CHECK
4. PRIMARY KEY
5. FOREIGN KEY










1. UNIQUE
 UNIQUE IS A CONSTRAINT WHICH IS ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR COLUMN WHICH
CANNOT ACCEPT REPEATED or DUPLICATE VALUES.

2. NOT NULL
 NOT NULL IS A CONSTRAINT WHICH IS ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR COLUMN WHICH
CANNOT BE NULL or WHICH ARE MANDATORY.

3. CHECK
 CHECK IS A CONSTRAINT WHICH IS ASSIGNED TO A PARTICULAR COLUMN FOR 
EXTRA VALIDATIONS.
 CHECK CONSTRAINT IS ASSIGNED WITH A CONDITION , IF THE CONDITION IS TRUE
 THE VALUE GETS ACCEPTED , ELSE REJECTED.








EG:-
1. CHECK(LENGTH(PHNO)=10)
2. CHECK(SAL>0)


**********
NOTE
----
NULL- IT IS KEYWORD WHICH REPRESENTS EMPTY CELL.
      ANY OPERATIONS PERFORMED WITH NULL , THE RESULT WLL BE NULL.










4. PRIMARY KEY
---------------
PRIMARY KEY IS A CONSTRAINT WHICH IS USED TO ASSIGN TO A COLUMN 
TO IDENTIFY A RECORD UNIQUELY FROM THE TABLE.
    -----------------------------------------

CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIMATY KEY
------------------------------
1. WE CAN HAVE ONLY ONE PRIMARY KEY IN A TABLE.
2. IT CANNOT ACCEPT REPEATED OR DUPLICATE VALUES.
3. IT CANNOT ACCEPT NULL.
4. IT IS A COMBINATION OF UNIQUE AND NOT NULL.
5. PRIMARY KEY IS NOT MANDATORY BUT RECOMENDED TO HAVE ONE IN TABLE.












5. FOREIGN KEY
---------------
 IT IS CONSTRAINT WHICH IS USED TO ESTABLISH THE CONNECTION B/W 
TWO TABLES.



CHARACTERISTICS OF FOREIGN KEY
-----------------------------------
1. WE CAN HAVE 'n' NO. OF FOREIGN KEYS IN A TABLE.
2. IT CAN ACCEPT REPEATED OR DUPLICATE VALUES.
3. IT CAN ACCEPT NULL.
4. IT IS NOT A COMBINATION OF UNIQUE AND NOT NULL.
5. IT IS PRESENT IN CHILD TABLE BUT ACTUALLY BELONGS TO PARENT TABLE.
6. IT IS ALSO REFERRED AS "REFERENTIAL INTIGRITY CONSTRAINT".

****
ONLY PRIMARY KEY CAN TRAVEL TO ANOTHER TABLE
WHEN IT TRAVELS IT BECOMES FOREIGN KEY.
