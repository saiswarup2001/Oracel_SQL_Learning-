A STATEMENT WHICH GIVES US RESULT IS KNOWN AS EXPRESSION.


EXPRESSION CONSISTS OF 2 TYPES
1. OPERAND
2. OPERATORS (+,-,*,/)

OPERAND CONSISTS OF TWO TYPES 
1. COLUMN NAME
2. LITERALS (DIRECT VALUES)

LITERALS ARE OF THREE TYPES 
1. NUMBER LITERAL
2. CHARACTER LITERAL
3. DATE LITERAL

> CHARACTER LITERAL and DATE LITERAL SHOULD BE ENCLOSED WITHIN SINGLE 
  QUOTES .






***
ALIAS

DISTINCT
----------

 TO REMOVE REPEATED VALUES OR DUPLICATED VALUES IN RESULT TABLE WE USE
 DISTINCT CLAUSE.


>FOR DISTINCT CLAUSE WE CAN PASS COLUMN_NAME OR AN EXPRESSION AS AN ARGUMENT.
>DISTINCT CLAUSE SHOULD BE USED AS THE FIRST ARGUMENT IN THE SELECT CLAUSE
>WE CAN PASS MULTIPLE COLUMNS FOR DISTINCT CLAUSE.
>IT REMOVES THE COMBINATION OF DUPLICATES FROM ALL THE COLUMNS.








1)  DIFF. B/W UNIQUE AN DISTINCT

WAQTD DIFFERENT BRANCH AND PER FROM STUDENT TABLE.

>WAQTD DIFFERENT SNAME,BRANCH AND PER FROM STUDENT TABLE.










>WAQTD DIFFERENT DEPTNO FROM EMP TABLE
>WAQTD DIFFERENT SAL FROM EMP TABLE
